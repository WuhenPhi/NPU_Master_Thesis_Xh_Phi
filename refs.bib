	abstract = {Atomically thin photodetectors based on 2D materials have attracted great interest due to their potential as highly energy-eﬃcient integrated devices. However, photoinduced carrier generation in these media is relatively poor due to low optical absorption, limiting device performance. Current methods for overcoming this problem, such as reducing contact resistances or back gating, tend to increase dark current and suﬀer slow response times. Here, we realize the avalanche eﬀect in a 2D material-based photodetector and show that avalanche multiplication can greatly enhance the device response of an ultrathin {InSe}-based photodetector. This is achieved by exploiting the large Schottky barrier formed between {InSe} and Al electrodes, enabling the application of a large bias voltage. Plasmonic enhancement of the photosensitivity, achieved by patterning arrays of Al nanodisks onto the {InSe} layer, further improves device eﬃciency. With an external quantum eﬃciency approaching 866\%, a dark current in the picoamp range, and a fast response time of 87 μs, this atomic layer device exhibits multiple signiﬁcant advances in overall performance for this class of devices.},

	abstract = {Graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures have attracted signiﬁcant attention because of their unique quantum conﬁnement eﬀect at the 2D limit. Multilayer nanosheets of {GaSÀGaSe} alloy are found to have a band gap (Eg) of 2.0À2.5 {eV} that linearly tunes the emission in red-to-green. However, the epitaxial growth of monolayers produces a drastic increase in this Eg to 3.3À3.4 {eV}, which blueshifts the emission to the {UV} region. First-principles calculations predict that the Eg of these {GaS} and {GaSe} monolayers should be 3.325 and 3.001 {eV}, respectively. As the number of layers is increased to three, both the direct/indirect Eg decrease signiﬁcantly; the indirect Eg approaches that of the multilayers. Oxygen adsorption can cause the direct/indirect Eg of {GaS} to converge, resulting in monolayers with a strong emission. This wide Eg tuning over the visible-to-{UV} range could provide an insight for the realization of full-colored ﬂexible and transparent light emitters and displays.},

Single- and few-layer {GaSe} nanoplates with the lateral size of up to tens of micrometers were produced. The orientation and nucleation sites of {GaSe} nanoplates were well-controlled. The 2D {GaSe} crystal-based photodetectors were demonstrated on both mechanically rigid {SiO}2/Si and ﬂexible mica substrates. Eﬃcient photoresponse was observed in 2D {GaSe} crystal devices on transparent ﬂexible mica substrates, regardless of repeated bending with diﬀerent radii. The controlled growth of 2D {GaSe} crystals with eﬃcient photoresponsivity opens up opportunities for both fundamental aspects and new applications in photodetectors.},

A correlation is identiﬁed between the number of layers and a Raman shift and intensity change. We found obvious contrast of the resistance of the material in the dark and when illuminated with visible light. In the photoconductivity measurement we observed a low dark current. The on−oﬀ ratio measured with a 405 nm at 0.5 {mW}/ mm2 light source is in the order of 103; the photoresponsivity is 17 {mA}/W, and the quantum eﬃciency is 5.2\%, suggesting possibility for photodetector and sensor applications. The photocurrent spectrum of few-layer {GaSe} shows an intense blue shift of the excitation edge and expanded band gap compared with bulk material.},
