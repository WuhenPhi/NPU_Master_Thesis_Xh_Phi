	abstract = {The flourishing development of multifunctional flexible electronics cannot leave the beneficial role of nature, which provides continuous inspiration in their material, structural, and functional designs. During the evolution of flexible electronics, some originated from nature, some were even beyond nature, and others were implantable or biodegradable eventually to nature. Therefore, the relationship between flexible electronics and nature is undoubtedly vital since harmony between nature and technology evolution would promote the sustainable development. Herein, materials selection and functionality design for flexible electronics that are mostly inspired from nature are first introduced with certain functionality even beyond nature. Then, frontier advances on flexible electronics including the main individual components (i.e., energy (the power source) and the sensor (the electric load)) are presented from nature, beyond nature, and to nature with the aim of enlightening the harmonious relationship between the modern electronics technology and nature. Finally, critical issues in next-generation flexible electronics are discussed to provide possible solutions and new insights in prospective exploration directions.},

	abstract = {Mechanically flexible mobile phones have been long anticipated due to the rapid development of thin-film electronics in the last couple of decades. However, to date, no such phone has been developed, largely due to a lack of flexible electronic components that are fast enough for the required wireless communications, in particular the speed-demanding front-end rectifiers. Here Schottky diodes based on amorphous indium–gallium–zinc–oxide (IGZO) are fabricated on flexible plastic substrates. Using suitable radio-frequency mesa structures, a range of IGZO thicknesses and diode sizes have been studied. The results have revealed an unexpected dependence of the diode speed on the IGZO thickness. The findings enable the best optimized flexible diodes to reach 6.3 GHz at zero bias, which is beyond the critical benchmark speed of 2.45 GHz to satisfy the principal frequency bands of smart phones such as those for cellular communication, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and global satellite positioning.},

	abstract = {Novel strategies for printed electronic devices have rapidly evolved, particularly using thin films of inorganic semiconductors for high-performance. As one of the basic electronic components, diodes provide important functionalities in circuits, such as high-frequency switching and rectifying. In this report, the fabrication of releasable radio frequency (RF) gallium arsenide (GaAs)-based Schottky diodes is presented. This technique yields thousands of fully formed diodes with uniform performance densely packed onto a wafer piece, where each diode is released and transferred using a micro-stamp only when needed. Such production technique not only reduces material cost, but also benefits design efforts, as circuit designing often requires iterative designs with incremental changes. With low forward voltage and fast switching action, these printable forms of Schottky diodes are operable at microwave frequencies for diverse circuit applications. A full wave bridge rectifier, popularly used for RF-to-direct current (DC) converting circuit in wireless power transmission, is fabricated on a flexible substrate using four printed Schottky diodes. The results reveal successful RF-to-DC conversion with efficiency of up to 36.4\% at principle frequency bands of mobile electronics, including cellular networks, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. The methods presented in this work form a simple yet robust path toward advanced high-performance flexible electronics.},

The individually addressable nanotube Schottky diode arrays were fabricated by arranging the top and bottom electrodes in a crossbar configuration on a free-standing layer consisting of position-controlled ZnO nanotubes on graphene films. The electrical characteristics of each Schottky diode in the arrays were investigated by measuring current–voltage characteristics. We also investigated the variation in device characteristics within an array by spatially mapping the barrier height of individual devices. Additionally, we further confirmed the excellent flexibility and electrical robustness of the free-standing and thin Schottky diode arrays under extreme bending conditions and over multiple cycles. Moreover, the photoresponses of the nanotube Schottky diode arrays were investigated by measuring their spectral responses and current–voltage characteristics under light illuminations, yielding a maximum photocurrent to dark current ratio of 1400 and responsivity of 106 A/W. We believe that this work provides a general and rational route for developing many other two-terminal one-dimensional nanostructure device arrays for ultra-high density electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

	abstract = {High-performance In–Ga–Zn–O (IGZO) Schottky diodes (SDs) were fabricated using hydrogenated IGZO (IGZO:H) at a maximum process temperature of 150 °C. IGZO:H was prepared by Ar + O2 + H2 sputtering. IGZO:H SDs on a glass substrate exhibited superior electrical properties with a very high rectification ratio of 3.8 × 1010, an extremely large Schottky barrier height of 1.17 eV, and a low ideality factor of 1.07. It was confirmed that the hydrogen incorporated during IGZO:H deposition increased the band gap energy from 3.02 eV (IGZO) to 3.29 eV (IGZO:H). Thus, it was considered that the increase in band gap energy (decrease in electron affinity) of IGZO:H contributed to the increase in the Schottky barrier height of the SDs. Angle-resolved hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that oxygen vacancies in IGZO:H were much fewer than those in IGZO, especially in the region near the film surface. Moreover, it was found that the density of near-conduction band minimum states in IGZO:H was lower than that in IGZO. Therefore, IGZO:H played a key role in improving the Schottky interface quality, namely, the increase of Schottky barrier height, decrease of oxygen vacancies, and reduction of near-conduction band minimum states. Finally, we fabricated a flexible IGZO:H SD on a poly(ethylene naphthalate) substrate, and it exhibited record electrical properties with a rectification ratio of 1.7 × 109, Schottky barrier height of 1.12 eV, and ideality factor of 1.10. To the best of our knowledge, both the IGZO:H SDs formed on glass and poly(ethylene naphthalate) substrates achieved the best performance among the IGZO SDs reported to date. The proposed method successfully demonstrated great potential for future flexible electronic applications.},

An experiment involving individual graphene sheets suspended over a microscale scaffold has allowed structure determination using transmission electron microscopy and diffraction, perhaps paving the way towards an answer to the question of why graphene can exist at all. The 'two-dimensional' sheets, it seems, are not flat, but wavy. The undulations are less pronounced in a two-layer system, and disappear in multilayer samples.

	abstract = {The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is the subject of a long-standing theoretical debate. According to the so-called Mermin-Wagner theorem, long-wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order of 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled. These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal, and the recent experimental observation of ripples in suspended graphene make these issues especially important. Besides the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of the stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest owing to its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. We address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear owing to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 80 A which is compatible with experimental findings (50-100 A). This unexpected result might be due to the multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.},

	abstract = {The dependence of the barrier height of metal‐semiconductor systems upon the metal work function is derived based on the following assumptions: (1) the contact between the metal and the semiconductor has an interfacial layer of the order of atomic dimensions; it is further assumed that this layer is transparent to electrons with energy greater than the potential barrier but can withstand potential across it. (2) The surface state density (per unit area per electron volt) at the interface is a property only of the semiconductor surface and is independent of the metal. The barrier height φBn is defined here as the energy needed by an electron at the Fermi level in the metal to enter the conduction band of the semiconductor.With the above assumptions, the barrier height for n‐type semiconductor‐metal contacts is found to be a linear combination of the metal work function φm and a quantity φ0 which is defined as the energy below which the surface states must be filled for charge neutrality at the semiconductor surface. The energy φ0 is measured from the edge of the valence band. For constant surface state density the theoretical expression obtained is φBn=γ(φm−χ)+(1−γ)(Eg−φ0)−Δφn,where χ and Eg are electron affinity and the band gap of the semiconductor, respectively, Δφn is the image force barrier lowering, and γ is a weighting factor which depends mainly on the surface state density and the thickness of the interfacial layer.The theoretical expression is compared to the presently available φBn VS φm data for Si, GaP, GaAs, and CdS, by fitting the data to straight lines using the method of least squares. The best straight‐line fit was obtained for the GaP data, with probable error limits on the slope and intercept of ±0.03 and ±0.13 eV, respectively.The parameter γ in the theoretical expression is found to range from 0.07 for GaAs to almost unity for the CdS data reported by Goodman indicating weak and strong dependence of the surface barrier height on the metal work function, respectively.The value of φ0 is roughly a third of the respective band gap energies for Si, GaP, and GaAs, and the surface state density for these semiconductors is found to be in the range 1013−1014 states/cm2/eV, for the experiments cited.Excessive scatter in the data points for the CdS data of Mead and Spitzer casts doubt on the significance of a straight‐line fit for this case. The data of Goodman for CdS obey the Schottky theory for a metal‐semiconductor barrier, but this agreement requires a value of the electron affinity χ which is different from the vacuum‐photothreshold value measured by other authors.},

	abstract = {A van der Waals (vdW) Schottky junction between two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is introduced here for both vertical and in-plane current devices: Schottky diodes and metal semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs). The Schottky barrier between conducting NbS2 and semiconducting n-MoS2 appeared to be as large as ∼0.5 eV due to their work-function difference. While the Schottky diode shows an ideality factor of 1.8-4.0 with an on-to-off current ratio of 103-105, Schottky-effect MESFET displays little gate hysteresis and an ideal subthreshold swing of 60-80 mV/dec due to low-density traps at the vdW interface. All MESFETs operate with a low threshold gate voltage of -0.5 ∼ -1 V, exhibiting easy saturation. It was also found that the device mobility is significantly dependent on the condition of source/drain (S/D) contact for n-channel MoS2. The highest room temperature mobility in MESFET reaches to approximately more than 800 cm2/V s with graphene S/D contact. The NbS2/n-MoS2 MESFET with graphene was successfully integrated into an organic piezoelectric touch sensor circuit with green OLED indicator, exploiting its predictable small threshold voltage, while NbS2/n-MoS2 Schottky diodes with graphene were applied to extract doping concentrations in MoS2 channel.},

	abstract = {The junctions formed at the contact between metallic electrodes and semiconductor materials are crucial components of electronic and optoelectronic devices1. Metal–semiconductor junctions are characterized by an energy barrier known as the Schottky barrier, whose height can, in the ideal case, be predicted by the Schottky–Mott rule2–4 on the basis of the relative alignment of energy levels. Such ideal physics has rarely been experimentally realized, however, because of the inevitable chemical disorder and Fermi-level pinning at typical metal–semiconductor interfaces2,5–12. Here we report the creation of van der Waals metal–semiconductor junctions in which atomically flat metal thin films are laminated onto two-dimensional semiconductors without direct chemical bonding, creating an interface that is essentially free from chemical disorder and Fermi-level pinning. The Schottky barrier height, which approaches the Schottky–Mott limit, is dictated by the work function of the metal and is thus highly tunable. By transferring metal films (silver or platinum) with a work function that matches the conduction band or valence band edges of molybdenum sulfide, we achieve transistors with a two-terminal electron mobility at room temperature of 260 centimetres squared per volt per second and a hole mobility of 175 centimetres squared per volt per second. Furthermore, by using asymmetric contact pairs with different work functions, we demonstrate a silver/molybdenum sulfide/platinum photodiode with an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 volts. Our study not only experimentally validates the fundamental limit of ideal metal–semiconductor junctions but also defines a highly efficient and damage-free strategy for metal integration that could be used in high-performance electronics and optoelectronics.},

	abstract = {A decade of intense research on two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals has revealed that their properties can differ greatly from those of the parent compound. These differences are governed by changes in the band structure due to quantum confinement and are most profound if the underlying lattice symmetry changes. Here we report a high-quality 2D electron gas in few-layer InSe encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride under an inert atmosphere. Carrier mobilities are found to exceed 103 cm2 V-1 s-1 and 104 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room and liquid-helium temperatures, respectively, allowing the observation of the fully developed quantum Hall effect. The conduction electrons occupy a single 2D subband and have a small effective mass. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that the bandgap increases by more than 0.5 eV with decreasing the thickness from bulk to bilayer InSe. The band-edge optical response vanishes in monolayer InSe, which is attributed to the monolayer's mirror-plane symmetry. Encapsulated 2D InSe expands the family of graphene-like semiconductors and, in terms of quality, is competitive with atomically thin dichalcogenides and black phosphorus.},

	abstract = {Tunability and stability in the electrical properties of 2D semiconductors pave the way for their practical applications in logic devices. A robust layered indium selenide (InSe) field-effect transistor (FET) with superior controlled stability is demonstrated by depositing an indium (In) doping layer. The optimized InSe FETs deliver an unprecedented high electron mobility up to 3700 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which can be retained with 60\% after 1 month. Further insight into the evolution of the position of the Fermi level and the microscopic device structure with different In thicknesses demonstrates an enhanced electron-doping behavior at the In/InSe interface. Furthermore, the contact resistance is also improved through the In insertion between InSe and Au electrodes, which coincides with the analysis of the low-frequency noise. The carrier fluctuation is attributed to the dominance of the phonon scattering events, which agrees with the observation of the temperature-dependent mobility. Finally, the flexible functionalities of the logic-circuit applications, for instance, inverter and not-and (NAND)/not-or (NOR) gates, are determined with these surface-doping InSe FETs, which establish a paradigm for 2D-based materials to overcome the bottleneck in the development of electronic devices.},

The FIB-fabricated InSe photodetectors with a low contact resistance exhibit record high responsivity and detectivity to the ultraviolet and visible lights. The optimal responsivity and detectivity up to 1.8 × 107 A W-1 and 1.1 × 1015 Jones, respectively, are much higher than those of the other 2D material-based photoconductors and phototransistors. Moreover, the inherent photoconductivity (PC) quantified by the value of normalized gain has also been discussed and compared. By excluding the contribution of artificial parameters, the InSe nanoflakes exhibit an ultrahigh normalized gain of 3.2 cm2 V-1, which is several orders of magnitude higher than those of MoS2, GaS, and other layer material nanostructures. A high electron mobility at room temperature reaching 450 cm2 V-1 s-1 has been confirmed to be one of the major causes of the inherent superior PC in the InSe nanoflakes. The oxygen-sensitized PC mechanism that enhances carrier lifetime and carrier collection efficiency has also been proposed. This work demonstrates the devices fabricated by the FIB technique using InSe nanostructures for highly efficient broad-band optical sensing and light harvesting, which is critical for development of the 2D material-based ultrathin flexible optoelectronics.},

	abstract = {2D semiconductors are excellent candidates for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics thanks to their electrical properties and strong light-matter interaction. To fabricate devices with optimal electrical properties, it is crucial to have both high-quality semiconducting crystals and ideal contacts at metal-semiconductor interfaces. Thanks to the mechanical exfoliation of van der Waals crystals, atomically thin high-quality single-crystals can easily be obtained in a laboratory. However, conventional metal deposition techniques can introduce chemical disorder and metal-induced mid-gap states that induce Fermi level pinning and can degrade the metal-semiconductor interfaces, resulting in poorly performing devices. In this article, the electrical contact characteristics of Au–InSe and graphite–InSe van der Waals contacts, obtained by stacking mechanically exfoliated InSe flakes onto pre-patterned Au or graphite electrodes without the need for lithography or metal deposition is explored. The high quality of the metal-semiconductor interfaces obtained by van der Waals contact allows to fabricate high-quality Schottky diodes based on the Au–InSe Schottky barrier. The experimental observation indicates that the contact barrier at the graphite–InSe interface is negligible due to the similar electron affinity of InSe and graphite, while the Au–InSe interfaces are dominated by a large Schottky barrier.},

However, due to the considerable reverse tunneling current, typical Schottky junctions cannot be widely applied in devices requiring high signal-to-noise ratios, such as photodetectors with high detectivity. Here, a van der Waals (vdW) Schottky junction is constructed by mechanically stacking a gold (Au) electrode onto a multilayer indium selenide (InSe) nanosheet, which shows an ultralow reverse current in sub-picoamperes and an excellent rectification ratio exceeding 106 at room temperature. The reverse current, which corresponds to the thermionic emission transport model, is independent of the applied reverse bias. As a result, the Au–InSe vdW Schottky junction device can function as an ultrasensitive photodetector with a photodetectivity over 2.4 × 1015 Jones, corresponding to a photoresponsivity of 853 A W−1 and a light on/off ratio exceeding 1 × 107.

Comparing with pristine InSe devices, InSe/Au photodetectors possess an additional capability of photodetection in visible to near-infrared (NIR) region. This intriguing phenomenon is attributed to the wavelength selective enhancement of pristine responsivities by hybridized quadrupole plasmons resonance of Au NPs. It is worth pointing out that the maximum of enhancement ratio in responsivity reaches up to ∼1200\% at a wavelength of 685 nm. In addition, owing to a large Schottky barrier difference formed between active layer and two asymmetric electrodes, the responsivities of dual-band InSe/Au photodetector could reach up to 369 and 244 mA/W at the wavelength of 365 and 685 nm under zero bias voltage, respectively. This work would provide an additional opportunity for developing multifunctional photodetectors with high performance based on two-dimensional materials, upgrading their capacity of photodetection in a complex environment.},

Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of this material in the ultra-thin regime have not been investigated yet. Here, we present our efforts to determine the Young's modulus of thin InSe (∼1–2 layers to ∼34 layers) flakes experimentally by using a buckling-based methodology. We find that the Young's modulus has a value of 23.1 ± 5.2 GPa, one of the lowest values reported to date for crystalline two-dimensional materials. This superior flexibility can be very attractive for different applications, such as strain engineering and flexible electronics.},

	abstract = {Flexible optoelectronics, as promising components hold shape-adaptive features and dynamic strain response under strain engineering for various intelligent applications. 2D materials with atomically thin layers are ideal for flexible optoelectronics because of their high flexibility and strain sensitivity. However, how the strain affects the performance of 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics is confused due to their hypersensitive features to external strain changes. It is necessary to establish an evaluation system to comprehend the influence of the external strain on the intrinsic properties of 2D materials and the photoresponse performance of their flexible optoelectronics. Here, a focused review of strain engineering in 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics is provided. The first attention is on the mechanical properties and the strain-engineered electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. An evaluation system with relatively comprehensive parameters in functionality and service capability is summarized to develop 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics in practical application. Based on the parameters, some strategies to improve the functionality and service capability are proposed. Finally, combining with strain engineering in future intelligence devices, the challenges and future perspective developing 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics are expounded.},

The object of this review is to give an overview of the recent progress to control the optical and electronics properties of 2D crystals, by means of strain engineering. We will concentrate on semiconducting layered materials, with especial emphasis in transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2). The effect of strain in other atomically thin materials like black phosphorus, silicene, etc, is also considered. The benefits of strain engineering in 2D crystals for applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics will be revised, and the open problems in the field will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Triggered by the growing needs of developing semiconductor devices at ever-decreasing scales, strain engineering of 2D materials has recently seen a surge of interest. The goal of this principle is to exploit mechanical strain to tune the electronic and photonic performance of 2D materials and to ultimately achieve high-performance 2D-material-based devices. Although strain engineering has been well studied for traditional semiconductor materials and is now routinely used in their manufacturing, recent experiments on strain engineering of 2D materials have shown new opportunities for fundamental physics and exciting applications, along with new challenges, due to the atomic nature of 2D materials. Here, recent advances in the application of mechanical strain into 2D materials are reviewed. These developments are categorized by the deformation modes of the 2D material–substrate system: in-plane mode and out-of-plane mode. Recent state-of-the-art characterization of the interface mechanics for these 2D material–substrate systems is also summarized. These advances highlight how the strain or strain-coupled applications of 2D materials rely on the interfacial properties, essentially shear and adhesion, and finally offer direct guidelines for deterministic design of mechanical strains into 2D materials for ultrathin semiconductor applications.},

It is found that monolayer InSe exhibits superior mechanical flexibility, which can sustain a tensile strain up to 27\% in the armchair direction. More importantly, a new phase with inversion symmetry denoted as phase-II is obtained when the tensile strain increases over 25\% along the zigzag direction, which is predicted to be metallic and thermodynamically stable at room temperature. And the phase-II InSe could show an out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio after the uniaxial tensile strain is larger than 5\%. Moreover, both uniaxial and biaxial compressive strains can trigger the indirect-to-direct band gap transition in the pristine monolayer InSe and its band gap decreases monotonously with the applied tensile strain, which offers an effective method to tune the electronic properties of monolayer InSe for its promising application in electronics and optoelectronics.},

The applied biaxial strain is controlled through the substrate expansion upon temperature increase and the effective strain transfer from the substrate to the thin InSe is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The bandgap change upon biaxial strain is determined through photoluminescence measurements, finding a gauge factor of up to ≈200 meV \%-1. The effect of biaxial strain on the electrical properties of the InSe devices is further characterized. In the dark state, a large increase of the current is observed upon applied strain which gives a piezoresistive gauge factor value of ≈450-1000, ≈5-12 times larger than that of other 2D materials and of state-of-the-art silicon strain gauges. Moreover, the biaxial strain tuning of the InSe bandgap also translates in a strain-induced redshift of the spectral response of the InSe photodetectors with ΔE cut-off ≈173 meV at a rate of ≈360 meV \%-1 of strain, indicating a strong strain tunability of the spectral bandwidth of the photodetectors.},

	abstract = {InSe, a member of the layered materials family, is a superior electronic and optical material which retains a direct bandgap feature from the bulk to atomically thin few-layers and high electronic mobility down to a single layer limit. We, for the first time, exploit strain to drastically modify the bandgap of two-dimensional (2D) InSe nanoflakes. We demonstrated that we could decrease the bandgap of a few-layer InSe flake by 160 meV through applying an in-plane uniaxial tensile strain to 1.06\% and increase the bandgap by 79 meV through applying an in-plane uniaxial compressive strain to 0.62\%, as evidenced by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The large reversible bandgap change of 239 meV arises from a large bandgap change rate (bandgap strain coefficient) of few-layer InSe in response to strain, 154 meV/\% for uniaxial tensile strain and 140 meV/\% for uniaxial compressive strain, representing the most pronounced uniaxial strain-induced bandgap strain coefficient experimentally reported in 2D materials. We developed a theoretical understanding of the strain-induced bandgap change through first-principles DFT and GW calculations. We also confirmed the bandgap change by photoconductivity measurements using excitation light with different photon energies. The highly tunable bandgap of InSe in the infrared regime should enable a wide range of applications, including electro-mechanical, piezoelectric and optoelectronic devices.},
